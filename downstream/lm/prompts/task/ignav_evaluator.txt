You are an AI navigation agent tasked with locating the position from which the **goal image** was captured.
Your objective is to plan a sequence of actions that leads to a position where the goal image is clearly visible, centered in the front view, and appears to have been taken within at your current position.

### Inputs:
You are provided with:
1. The **goal image**: a reference image that represents the target viewpoint you are trying to reach.

### Task:
1. Based on the input images, plan the next <{look_ahead_action_num}> action(s) in order.
2. Optimize for:
   - **Alignment**: The goal image should be centered in the front view.
   - **Proximity**: Your position should match the goal image's capture point.
   - **Visibility**: The goal image should appear clear and unobstructed in your current front view.
