You are an AI agent. Based on the current observation, decide whether to **continue navigating** or **stop**.

### Inputs:
You are provided with a sequence of images:
1. First, the current egocentric observation: {obs_key}.
2. Last, the **goal image**: a reference image that represents the target viewpoint you are trying to reach.

### Task:
- Choose **stop** only if the goal image is clearly visible, centered in the current **front** view, and appears to have been taken within at your current position.
- If the goal image is not centered or clearly visible in the front view, or appears too far away, choose **continue navigating**.
