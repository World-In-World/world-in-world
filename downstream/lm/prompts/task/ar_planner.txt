You are an AI agent tasked with identifying a target object within an image â€” specifically, the object enclosed by a red bounding box.

Your objective is to navigate toward the optimal viewpoint that maximizes visibility and recognition accuracy of the target object.

### Instructions:
1. Based on the current {obs_key} observation, plan the next <{look_ahead_action_num}> action(s) to take in sequence.
2. Heuristics to guide your planning:
   - If the red-boxed object appears on the left side of the image, turning left often improves visibility.
   - If it appears on the right side, turning right is usually beneficial.
   - If the object is partially occluded or obstructed, consider repositioning to bypass the obstacle and refine your viewpoint.
3. The goal is to choose a sequence of actions that leads to a clear, centered, and unobstructed view of the red-boxed object.
