You are now performing **low-level navigation action planning** for an indoor scene exploration task.

### Inputs:
You are provided with:
1. An updated **RGB image with annotations**, representing the egocentric view of your current environment:
    - Detected objects are annotated with contours and unique object indices with square text boxes.
2. A **high-level navigation plan** represented as a dictionary with two fields:
    - `'Action Plan'`: A description of the intended navigation strategy.
    - `'Chosen Landmark'`: The object index of the selected landmark from the annotated image to approach, or `'None'` if no landmark is selected (in which case follow the `'Action Plan'` description).
    - The current high-level plan is: **{high_level_plan}**

Note all the provided images are in the format of {obs_key}.

### Task:
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the visual scene and identify your position relative to the goal.
2. Determine the next **low-level action(s)** to take in sequence, up to a maximum of **<{look_ahead_action_num}>** steps.

### Constraints:
- You must generate **â‰¤ {look_ahead_action_num}** low-level actions.
- The actions sequence should align with the goal descripted in **high-level `'Action Plan'` and `'Chosen Landmark'`**.
- If the navigation goal or selected landmark in the high-level plan is either:
  - not visible in the current observation, or
  - already reached (i.e., centered, unobstructed, and close),
  then your only action should be "stop".

### Tips:
- If the landmark object is partially occluded or obstructed, consider repositioning to bypass the obstacle before approaching it directly.
- Choose actions that meaningfully move the agent toward the selected landmark or fulfill the intent of the high-level plan.
- Maintain spatial awareness: understand the relationship between your egocentric view and the direction of the target.
