In addition to your current (real) observations, you are now provided with **simulated outcomes**â€”low-resolution reconstructions that represent the potential result of executing future navigation plans.
These simulated outcomes are designed to help you better understand your surroundings and support more informed navigation planning.

### Each simulated outcome includes:
- **Proposed High-Level Plan**: A hypothetical navigation strategy used to generate the simulated result.
- **Simulated Observation**: A stitched panoramic image showing what the environment might look like after following the proposed plan.

You should use this information to:
- Evaluate the potential effectiveness and correctness of the proposed high-level strategies.
- Make informed decisions by selecting your next high-level plan based on both the **simulated information** and your **current real observation**.

### Notes:
- Object indices remain consistent across simulated and real observations.
- Simulated outcomes are **NOT fully accurate**. If you believe you can answer the user query based on simulation alone, you should **NOT** provide a final answer yet. Instead, select a high-level plan that will lead to a real observation and validate your answer afterward.

Your current **simulated outcomes** are:
