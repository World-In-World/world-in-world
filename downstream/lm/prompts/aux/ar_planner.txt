You are now simulating imagined future trajectories by generating hypothetical actions and their corresponding observations.

You can use these imagined obserations to:
- Evaluate the potential outcomes of different action sequences.
- Make informed navigation decisions by selecting the next best action based on predicted future states and your current state.

Note:
- Each imagined frame is annotated with the specific action taken and its index at the top of the image.
- Pay attention to the presence of red bounding boxes indicating the target object. If the target is not visible in a frame, this indicates a poor action.
- You should adjust your action selection strategy to avoid such failure states.
