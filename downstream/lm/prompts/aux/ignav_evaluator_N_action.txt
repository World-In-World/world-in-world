You are now simulating imagined future trajectories by generating hypothetical action plans and their corresponding observations.

You can use these simulated ('Action Plan', 'Predicted Observation') pairs to:
- Evaluate the potential reward of different action plans.
- Make informed navigation decisions by replan the action(s) based on the simluated future states.

Note:
- Each imagined frame is also annotated with the specific action taken and its index at the top of the image.
