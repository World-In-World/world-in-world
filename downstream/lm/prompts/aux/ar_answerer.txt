You now have a composite visualization in your mind, created by stitching together imagined views from multiple perspectives around your current position.
These perspectives are centered on the target object (enclosed within the red bounding box).

You can use these synthesized views to:
- Improve object identification accuracy.
- Make more informed recognition decisions.
