World-in-World is a unified **closed-loop** benchmark and toolkit for evaluating **visual world models (WMs)** by their **embodied utility** rather than only image or video appearance. World-in-World provides: (1) a unified online planning strategy that works with different WMs, (2) a unified action API that adapts to text, viewpoint, and low‚Äëlevel controls, and (3) a task suite covering Active Recognition (AR), Active Embodied QA (A‚ÄëEQA), Image‚ÄëGoal Navigation (IGNav), and Robotic Manipulation.

## ‚ú® Overview

![Overview](assets/overview.png)

In this work, we propose World-in-World, which wraps generative <u>World</u> models <u>In</u> a closed-loop <u>World</u> interface to measure their practical utility for embodied agents. *We test whether generated worlds actually enhance embodied reasoning and task performance*‚Äîfor example, helping an agent perceive the environment, plan and execute actions, and re-plan based on new observations *within such a closed loop*. Establishing this evaluation framework is essential for tracking genuine progress across the rapidly expanding landscape of visual world models and embodied AI.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1) Checklist for running an evaluation

For any task, complete the following steps in order.

1. **Set up environments.**
   - **AR, IGNav, AEQA:** set up Habitat‚Äësim as described in [01_setup_env.md: Environment for Habitat‚Äësim](docs/01_setup_env.md#environment-for-Habitat-sim).
   - **Manipulation:** coming soon.
2. **Download scene datasets.**
   - **AR:** download MP3D as described in [02_evaluation_datasets.md: Common Steps](docs/02_evaluation_datasets.md#common-steps).
   - **IGNav, AEQA:** download HM3D as described in [02_evaluation_datasets.md: Common Steps](docs/02_evaluation_datasets.md#common-steps).
   - **Manipulation:** coming soon.
3. **Download evaluation episodes.**
   - **AR:** see [02_evaluation_datasets.md: Download AR evaluation episodes](docs/02_evaluation_datasets.md#download-AR-evaluation-episodes).
   - **IGNav:** see [02_evaluation_datasets.md: Download IGNav evaluation episodes](docs/02_evaluation_datasets.md#download-ignav-evaluation-episodes).
   - **AEQA:** see [02_evaluation_datasets.md: Download AEQA evaluation episodes](docs/02_evaluation_datasets.md#download-AEQA-evaluation-episodes).
   - **Manipulation:** coming soon.
4. **Deploy policies (VLM policy, heuristic policy, diffusion policy).**
   - **AR:** deploy VLM policy as in [03_run_commands.md: VLM Deployment](docs/03_run_commands.md#VLM-Deployment). If you use a heuristic policy, you can skip the VLM step.
   - **IGNav:** deploy VLM policy as in [03_run_commands.md: VLM Deployment](docs/03_run_commands.md#VLM-Deployment). If you use a heuristic policy, you can skip the VLM step.
   - **AEQA:** deploy VLM policy as in [03_run_commands.md: VLM Deployment](docs/03_run_commands.md#VLM-Deployment).
   - **Manipulation:** VLM and diffusion policy deployment coming soon.
5. **Deploy other task‚Äërelated models if needed.**
   - **AR:** deploy the SAM2 server as in [03_run_commands.md: SAM2 Deployment](docs/03_run_commands.md#SAM2-Deployment).
   - **IGNav:** no extra task models.
   - **AEQA:** deploy the Grounding SAM2 server as in [03_run_commands.md: Grounding SAM2 Deployment](docs/03_run_commands.md#Grounding-SAM2-Deployment).
   - **Manipulation:** no extra task models.
6. **Deploy the WM server.**
   - **AR, IGNav, AEQA:** see [03_run_commands.md: World Model Deployment](docs/03_run_commands.md#World-Model-Deployment) and [WMs for Habitat‚Äësim Tasks](docs/03_run_commands.md#WMs-for-Habitat-sim-Tasks).
   - **Manipulation:** see [03_run_commands.md: World Model Deployment](docs/03_run_commands.md#World-Model-Deployment) and [WMs for Manipulation Tasks](docs/03_run_commands.md#WMs-for-Manipulation-Tasks).
7. **Run the evaluation script.**
   - **AR, IGNav, AEQA:** see [03_run_commands.md: Run the Evaluation Scripts](docs/03_run_commands.md#Run-the-Evaluation-Scripts).
   - **Manipulation:** coming soon.
8. **Accumulate results.**
   - **AR, IGNav, AEQA:** see [03_run_commands.md: Get the Evaluation Results](docs/03_run_commands.md#Get-the-Evaluation-Results).
   - **Manipulation:** coming soon.

After the first run, the environment and datasets are in place. For later runs, you usually only repeat **steps 4‚Äì8**.
If you encounter any issue, please feel free to open an issue or contact us.
